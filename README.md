# PredictiveML

This project leverages machine learning to distinguish between participants in a fitness experiment, that have correctly completed fitness exercises versus those that havenâ€™t and what mistakes were made, if any. We will assess how accurately we can classify the exercises performed by non-participants solely based on their Human Activity Recognition (HAR) data.
