# PredictiveML

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to create a model that distinguishes between fitness participants that have completed exercises correctly versus those that havenâ€™t and what their mistakes were. This model will assess how accurately we can classify the exercises performed by non-participants solely based on their Human Activity Recognition (HAR) data.
